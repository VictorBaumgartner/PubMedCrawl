39890587,Digital health competences and AI beliefs as conditions for the practice of evidence-based medicine: a study of prospective physicians in Canada.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become pivotal in enhancing medical care and patient outcomes. With the diffusion of innovation in healthcare organizations, EBM can be expected to depend on medical professionals' competences with digital health (dHealth) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the effect of dHealth competences and perceptions of AI on the adoption of EBM among prospective physicians. By focusing on dHealth and AI technologies, the study seeks to inform the redesign of medical curricula to better prepare students for the demands of evidence-based medical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered online to students at the University of Montreal's medical school, which has approximately 1,400 enrolled students. The survey included questions on students' dHealth competences, perceptions of AI, and their practice of EBM. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed data from 177 respondents to test our research model. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that medical students possess foundational knowledge competences of dHealth technologies and perceive AI to play an important role in the future of medicine. Yet, their experiential competences with dHealth technologies are limited. Our findings reveal that experiential dHealth competences are significantly related to the practice of EBM (beta = 0.42, p < 0.001), as well as students' perceptions of the role of AI in the future of medicine (beta = 0.39, p < 0.001), which, in turn, also affect EBM (beta = 0.19, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the necessity of enhancing students' competences related to dHealth and considering their perceptions of the role of AI in the medical profession. In particular, the low levels of experiential dHealth competences highlight a promising starting point for training future physicians while simultaneously strengthening their practice of EBM. Accordingly, we suggest revising medical curricula to focus on providing students with practical experiences with dHealth and AI technologies.",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2025.2459910
39828281,"The role of HSPA14 in breast cancer: implications for tumorigenesis, immune response modulation, and personalized therapies.",12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: Heat shock proteins have been implicated in the process of carcinogenesis. HSPA14, a member of the heat shock protein family, remains poorly understood in terms of its significance and pathomechanisms in breast cancer. METHODS: We analyzed the expression levels of HSPA14 and its prognostic significance in breast cancer using TCGA data. TCGA data was used to investigate the association between HSPA14 expression and clinicopathological features in breast cancer patients. GSEA analysis was conducted to identify the biological function of HSPA14. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlation between HSPA14 expression and immune cell infiltration, as well as immune checkpoint genes. Single cell transcriptomic data from GSE114727 was utilized to calculate the expression of HSPA14 in different cell subpopulations. The data on HSPA14 levels and drug sensitivity were extracted from the CellMiner dataset. The mRNA expression of HSPA14 was validated through cell experiments. RESULTS: HSPA14 expression is elevated in breast cancer, which is associated with poor overall survival. It can serve as a diagnostic biomarker for breast cancer patients. Pathway analysis revealed that HSPA14-associated differential genes are involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, cellular response to heat stress, and more. Additionally, HSPA14 expression is significantly correlated with the immune microenvironment. The expression of HSPA14 may also indicate drug sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Our study elucidates the involvement of HSPA14 in tumorigenesis, particularly in modulating the immune response, shaping the immune microenvironment, and contributing to drug resistance, which are pivotal for the development of personalized breast cancer therapies.","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2025.2452922
39787021,Addressing challenges in the implementation of precision oncology: An in-depth examination of limitations and disparities in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in the Brazilian public healthcare system (SUS).,12/2025,0.553,"Precision oncology (PO) has significantly advanced lung cancer treatment by enabling personalised therapy based on genetic mutations. However, equitable access to molecular testing and targeted therapies remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings such as the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS). To identify the challenges faced by SUS in caring for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in terms of access to Precision Oncology. Retrospective study with data from e-medical records of NSCLC treated between 2015-2021. 174 patients with NSCLC were included, of which 56% were females and 63% had non-squamous histology - 80% of early-stage patients and 32% of advanced-stage patients missed access to genomic testing, primarily due to short life expectancy or insufficient sample size. Only one participant underwent testing for all recommended biomarkers. Among patients with actionable mutations, 40% did not receive targeted therapy; however, regarding EGFR mutations, only 8% did not get it. Access to targeted therapy was associated with improved survival outcomes. The study highlights critical challenges and missed opportunities in the implementation of precision oncology for NSCLC management within the SUS and underscores the need for strategies to improve access to genomic testing in the public health setting.",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2025.2450412
40055694,A systematic review of large language model (LLM) evaluations in clinical medicine.,3/2025,0.643,"BACKGROUND: Large Language Models (LLMs), advanced AI tools based on transformer architectures, demonstrate significant potential in clinical medicine by enhancing decision support, diagnostics, and medical education. However, their integration into clinical workflows requires rigorous evaluation to ensure reliability, safety, and ethical alignment. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review examines the evaluation parameters and methodologies applied to LLMs in clinical medicine, highlighting their capabilities, limitations, and application trends. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and arXiv databases, encompassing both peer-reviewed and preprint studies. Studies were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify original research evaluating LLM performance in medical contexts. RESULTS: The results reveal a growing interest in leveraging LLM tools in clinical settings, with 761 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. While general-domain LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and GPT-4, dominated evaluations (93.55%), medical-domain LLMs accounted for only 6.45%. Accuracy emerged as the most commonly assessed parameter (21.78%). Despite these advancements, the evidence base highlights certain limitations and biases across the included studies, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and robust evaluation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: The exponential growth in LLM research underscores their transformative potential in healthcare. However, addressing challenges such as ethical risks, evaluation variability, and underrepresentation of critical specialties will be essential. Future efforts should prioritize standardized frameworks to ensure safe, effective, and equitable LLM integration in clinical practice.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-025-02954-4
39879862,Timing in orthopaedic surgery - Rethinking traditional myths with a critical perspective.,3/2025,0.643,"PURPOSE: Standard operating procedures aim to achieve a standardized and assumedly high-quality therapy. However, in orthopaedic surgery, the aspect of temporal urgency is often based on surgical tradition and experience. At a time of evidence-based medicine, it is necessary to question these temporal guidelines. The following review will therefore address the most important temporal guidelines in orthopaedic surgery and discuss their practical relevance and potential need for optimization. METHODS: The systematic review features a literature review by database search in ""PubMed"" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for time to surgery in terms of (1) ""proximal femoral fractures"", (2) ""femoral neck fractures"", (3) ""proximal humeral fractures"", (4) ""ligament and tendon injuries"", (5) ""spinal cord injuries"", (6) ""open fractures"" and (7) ""fracture-related infections"". For every diagnosis, hypotheses on timing were set up and checked for evidence. RESULTS: There is solid clinical evidence supporting the initiation of treatment within 24 h for specific conditions like the surgical treatment of proximal femur fractures and prompt decompression of spinal cord injuries. However, for other scenarios such as the 6-hour rule for open fractures, joint-preserving femoral neck fractures, timing of ligament injuries, humeral head fractures and fracture-related infections there is currently no reliable evidence to guide prompt surgical treatment. CONCLUSION: Based on the current data, resource-adapted surgical planning seems reasonable. Further research in these areas is necessary to determine the best timing of treatment and address existing doubts.",Injury,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2025.112165
40101924,Determining IFI44 as a key lupus nephritis's biomarker through bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) emerges as a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), significantly affecting patient survival. Despite improvements in treatment reducing LN's morbidity and mortality, existing therapies remain suboptimal, emphasizing the necessity for early detection to improve patient outcomes. METHODS: This study employs bioinformatics and machine learning to identify and validate potential LN biomarkers using immunohistochemistry (IHC). It explores the relationship between these biomarkers and the clinical and pathological characteristics of LN, assessing their prognostic significance. The research provides deeper mechanistic insights by employing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Additionally, the study characterizes the immune profiles of LN patients through the CIBERSORT algorithm, focusing on the role of interferon-inducible protein 44 (IFI44) as a key biomarker. RESULTS: IFI44 shows elevated expression in LN-affected kidneys, compared to healthy controls. The levels of IFI44 positively correlate with serum creatinine and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and inversely with serum complement C3 and initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). CONCLUSION: IFI44 is identified as a promising biomarker for LN, offering potential to refine the assessment of disease progression and predict clinical outcomes. This facilitates the development of more personalized treatment strategies for LN patients.",Renal failure,https://doi.org/10.1080/0886022X.2025.2479575
40094536,Immunohistochemical and bioinformatics analysis of the placental BCL-2 and Beclin-1 expressions in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine the alterations in apoptosis and autophagy in placental tissues from normal pregnancies compared to those affected by preeclampsia (PE) and HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome. We analysed the expression of autophagy-associated proteins, Beclin-1 and BCL-2, in human placental tissues and assessed their variations in placentas from pregnancies complicated by PE and HELLP syndrome by immunohistochemical (IHC) and in silico analyses. METHODS: An experimental case-control study was performed, involving 40 pregnant women complicated with preeclampsia, 25 pregnant women with HELLP syndrome, and 40 healthy pregnant women. The placental sections were stained with BCL-2 and Beclin-1 immunostains and subjected to IHC examination. The results of the IHC staining were assessed using semi-quantitative analysis. In silico analyses were performed using STRING and Cytoscape software to construct protein interaction networks for BCL-2 and Beclin-1 in PE and HELLP syndrome, followed by Gene Ontology analysis of common interactors to identify significant biological pathways. RESULTS: Both BCL-2 expression was significantly decreased (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and Beclin-1 staining was significantly increased (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) in the PE group and HELLP group compared to the control group. The changes in BCL-2 and Beclin-1 expression between PE and the HELLP group were also statistically significant. BCL2 expression was notably lower (p < 0.0001), and Beclin-1 staining was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the HELLP group compared to the PE group. In PE, BCL-2 interactors were enriched in apoptosis, cytokine production, and cell proliferation pathways, while Beclin-1 interactors were linked to autophagy and phosphatidylinositol-mediated signalling. In HELLP, BCL-2 interactors were involved in inflammatory response regulation, whereas Beclin-1 interactors were associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling and immune regulation. CONCLUSIONS: The differential expression patterns of BCL-2 and Beclin-1 between the PE and HELLP groups suggest that these proteins play distinct roles in the pathophysiology of these conditions.",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2025.2478577
39789882,Long-term impact of molecular epidemiology shifts of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on severity and mortality of bloodstream infection.,12/2025,0.553,"A 2019 nationwide study in Japan revealed the predominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) types in bloodstream infections (BSIs) to be sequence type (ST)8-carrying SCCmec type IV (ST8-MRSA-IV) and clonal complex 1-carrying SCCmec type IV (CC1-MRSA-IV). However, detailed patient characteristics and how these MRSA types evolve over time remain largely unknown. In this long-term single-center study, MRSA strains isolated from blood cultures at Nagasaki University Hospital from 2012 to 2019 were sequenced and analyzed. Additionally, we compared the SCCmec types and patient characteristics identified in this study with previous data from our hospital spanning 2003-2007 and 2008-2011. Over this 16-year period, SCCmec type II decreased significantly from 79.2% to 15.5%, while type IV increased from 18.2% to 65.5%. This shift in SCCmec types was associated with notable changes in severity and outcomes; the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score decreased from 5.8 to 3.1; in-hospital mortality declined from 39.8% to 15.5%. In contrast, no significant changes in patient demographics, such as age, sex, or underlying diseases, were observed. Between 2012 and 2019, the major combinations of SCCmec type and sequence type were ST8-MRSA-IV, ST8-MRSA-I, CC1-MRSA-IV, and ST5-MRSA-II. Additionally, ST8-MRSA-IV was divided into CA-MRSA/J, t5071-ST8-MRSA-IV, and USA300-like clone based on the results of molecular analysis. These major combinations showed similar drug resistance patterns, molecular characteristics, and phylogenetic features to those identified in nationwide surveillance. This study highlights the evolving nature of MRSA types in bloodstream infections, correlating with improved patient outcomes over time.",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2024.2449085

METHODS: In this study, through the methods of network pharmacology and molecular docking, the material basis and action target of YGD in preventing and treating OP were analyzed, and the potential target and mechanism of YGD in preventing and treating OP were clarified by TMT quantitative protein and experiment. RESULTS: Network pharmacology and molecular docking revealed that the active components of YGD were mainly stigmasterol and flavonoids. Molecular docking mainly studied the strong binding ability of stigmasterol to the target. Animal proteomics verified the related mechanism of YGD in preventing and treating OP. Based on the KEGG enrichment of network pharmacology and histology, our animal experiments in vivo verified that YGD may play a role in the treatment of OP by mediating hif1- alpha/vegf/glut1 signal pathway. CONCLUSIONS: YGD prevention and treatment of OP may be achieved by interfering with multiple targets. This study confirmed that it may promote osteoblast proliferation and protect osteoblast function by up-regulating the expression of proteins related to HIF signal pathway.",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2024.2449225
39745207,Metabolomics reveals alterations in gut-derived uremic toxins and tryptophan metabolism in feline chronic kidney disease.,12/2025,0.553,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the most common conditions affecting felines, yet the metabolic alterations underlying its pathophysiology remain poorly understood, hindering progress in identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive view of metabolic changes in feline CKD across conserved biochemical pathways and evaluate their progression throughout the disease continuum. Using a multi-biomatrix high-throughput metabolomics approach, serum and urine samples from CKD-affected cats (n = 94) and healthy controls (n = 84) were analyzed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Significant disruptions were detected in tryptophan (indole, kynurenine, serotonin), tyrosine, and carnitine metabolism, as well as in the urea cycle. Circulating gut-derived uremic toxins, including indoxyl-sulfate, p-cresyl-sulfate, and trimethylamine-N-oxide, were markedly increased, primarily due to impaired renal excretion. However, alternative mechanisms, such as enhanced bacterial formation from dietary precursors like tryptophan, tyrosine, carnitine, and betaine, could not be ruled out. Overall, the findings suggest that metabolic disturbances in feline CKD are largely driven by the accumulation of gut-derived uremic toxins derived from precursors highly abundant in the feline diet. These insights may link the strict carnivorous nature of felines to CKD pathophysiology and highlight potential avenues for studying preventive or therapeutic interventions.",The veterinary quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2024.2447601
39743726,Proteomics reveals the key transcription-related factors mediating obstructive nephropathy in pediatric patients and mice.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive nephropathy is one of the leading causes of kidney injury in infants and children. Increasing evidence has shown that transcription-related factors (TRFs), including transcription factors and cofactors, are associated with kidney diseases. However, a global landscape of dysregulated TRFs in pediatric patients with obstructive nephropathy is lacking. METHODS: We mined the data from our previous proteomic study for the TRF profile in pediatric patients with obstructive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to determine pathways that were enriched in the dysregulated TRFs. We then took advantage of kidney samples from patients and UUO mice to verify the selected TRFs by immunoblots. RESULTS: The proteomes identified a total of 140 human TRFs with 28 upregulated and 1 downregulated, and 160 murine TRFs with 88 upregulated and 1 downregulated (fold change >2 or <0.5). These dysregulated TRFs were enriched in the inflammatory signalings, such as janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. Of note, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway, which is the master regulator of organ fibrosis, was enriched in both patients and mice. Cross-species analysis showed 16 key TRFs that might mediate obstructive nephropathy in patients and UUO mice. Moreover, we verified a significant dysregulation of three previously unexplored TRFs; prohibitin (PHB), regulatory factor X 1 (RFX1), and activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox protein (ADNP), in patients and mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered key TRFs in the obstructed kidneys and provided additional molecular insights into obstructive nephropathy.",Renal failure,https://doi.org/10.1080/0886022X.2024.2443032
39709554,Faecal metaproteomics analysis reveals a high cardiovascular risk profile across healthy individuals and heart failure patients.,12/2025,0.553,"The gut microbiota is a crucial link between diet and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Using fecal metaproteomics, a method that concurrently captures human gut and microbiome proteins, we determined the crosstalk between gut microbiome, diet, gut health, and CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors (age, BMI, sex, blood pressure) explained < 10% of the proteome variance. However, unsupervised human protein-based clustering analysis revealed two distinct CVD risk clusters (low-risk and high-risk) with different blood pressure (by 9 mmHg) and sex-dependent dietary potassium and fiber intake. In the human proteome, the low-risk group had lower angiotensin-converting enzymes, inflammatory proteins associated with neutrophil extracellular trap formation and auto-immune diseases. In the microbial proteome, the low-risk group had higher expression of phosphate acetyltransferase that produces SCFAs, particularly in fiber-fermenting bacteria. This model identified severity across phenotypes in heart failure patients and long-term risk of cardiovascular events in a large population-based cohort. These findings underscore multifactorial gut-to-host mechanisms that may underlie risk factors for CVD.",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2441356

However, little is known about the protein expression profiling in busulfan treated testis. METHODS: This research studies the proteomics for busulfan-induced spermatogenesis disorder. The model of busulfan-induced mouse spermatogenesis disorder was subjected to label-free quantification proteomics analysis. Clustering heatmap, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and protein interaction analyses were performed and validated by molecular experiments. RESULTS: The busulfan-treated mouse model showed abnormal testis morphology and reduced sperm number and testis weight. Testicular and sperm damage was most severe at 30 days after busulfan treatment. The busulfan-treated mouse testes were subjected to label-free quantification proteomics, which revealed 190 significantly downregulated proteins including lactate dehydrogenase A like 6B (LDHAL6B) and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). In addition, the testis and spermatozoa in the epididymis progressively improved from 70 to 80 days after busulfan treatment, and that the testis weight and spermatozoa number gradually increased from 40 to 80 days after busulfan treatment. Western blotting revealed that LDHAL6B protein significantly increased at 10 days, decreased from 20 to 60 days, and then gradually elevated from 70 to 80 days after busulfan treatment. CONCLUSION: We revealed 190 significantly downregulated proteins in busulfan-treated mouse testes at 30 days and indicated that 70 days is the cut-off point of spermatogenic recovery for busulfan-treated mouse testis, increasing our understanding of this reproductive disorder model. An increased understanding of busulfan's toxic effect will help to prevent and treat reproductive diseases.",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2024.2442534

In this exploratory study, we employed an electrochemistry-based targeted metabolomics platform to assess the metabolic effects of three randomly-assigned treatments: escitalopram, duloxetine, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in 163 treatment-naive outpatients with major depressive disorder. Serum samples from baseline and 12 weeks post-treatment were analyzed using targeted liquid chromatography-electrochemistry for metabolites related to tryptophan, tyrosine metabolism and related pathways. Changes in metabolite concentrations related to each treatment arm were identified and compared to define metabolic signatures of exposure. In addition, association between metabolites and depressive symptom severity (assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD(17)]) and anxiety symptom severity (assessed with the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HRSA(14)]) were evaluated, both at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Significant reductions in serum serotonin level and increases in tryptophan-derived indoles that are gut bacterially derived were observed with escitalopram and duloxetine arms but not in CBT arm. These include indole-3-propionic acid (I3PA), indole-3-lactic acid (I3LA) and Indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin. Purine-related metabolites were decreased across all arms.

Our findings revealed a concurrent outbreak of M. pneumoniae, with the positivity rate rising sharply to 9.62% from July 2023, compared to the 0.16% to 4.06% positivity rate observed during the 2020-2022 COVID-19 pandemic. P1-1 had a higher odds ratio of co-detecting opportunistic pathogens. However, no significant differences were observed in the co-detection odds ratio between children and other age groups in P1-2. This study is the first to demonstrate differences in relative abundance, diversity of respiratory microbiota and co-detection rate of opportunistic pathogen between M. pneumoniae P1-1 and P1-2. Through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) metagenomic and host transcriptomic analyses, we identified variations in co-detection rates of M. pneumoniae P1-1 genotype with opportunistic pathogens like S. pneumoniae, alterations in respiratory microbiota composition, lung inflammation, and disruption of ciliary function. Consistent with the results of host transcriptome, we found that P1-1 infections were associated with significantly higher rates of requiring respiratory support and mechanical ventilation compared to P1-2 infections (Fisher's exact test, p-value = 0.035/0.004).

39709554,Faecal metaproteomics analysis reveals a high cardiovascular risk profile across healthy individuals and heart failure patients.,12/2025,0.553,"The gut microbiota is a crucial link between diet and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Using fecal metaproteomics, a method that concurrently captures human gut and microbiome proteins, we determined the crosstalk between gut microbiome, diet, gut health, and CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors (age, BMI, sex, blood pressure) explained < 10% of the proteome variance. However, unsupervised human protein-based clustering analysis revealed two distinct CVD risk clusters (low-risk and high-risk) with different blood pressure (by 9 mmHg) and sex-dependent dietary potassium and fiber intake. In the human proteome, the low-risk group had lower angiotensin-converting enzymes, inflammatory proteins associated with neutrophil extracellular trap formation and auto-immune diseases. In the microbial proteome, the low-risk group had higher expression of phosphate acetyltransferase that produces SCFAs, particularly in fiber-fermenting bacteria. This model identified severity across phenotypes in heart failure patients and long-term risk of cardiovascular events in a large population-based cohort. These findings underscore multifactorial gut-to-host mechanisms that may underlie risk factors for CVD.",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2441356

However, little is known about the protein expression profiling in busulfan treated testis. METHODS: This research studies the proteomics for busulfan-induced spermatogenesis disorder. The model of busulfan-induced mouse spermatogenesis disorder was subjected to label-free quantification proteomics analysis. Clustering heatmap, gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and protein interaction analyses were performed and validated by molecular experiments. RESULTS: The busulfan-treated mouse model showed abnormal testis morphology and reduced sperm number and testis weight. Testicular and sperm damage was most severe at 30 days after busulfan treatment. The busulfan-treated mouse testes were subjected to label-free quantification proteomics, which revealed 190 significantly downregulated proteins including lactate dehydrogenase A like 6B (LDHAL6B) and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7). In addition, the testis and spermatozoa in the epididymis progressively improved from 70 to 80 days after busulfan treatment, and that the testis weight and spermatozoa number gradually increased from 40 to 80 days after busulfan treatment. Western blotting revealed that LDHAL6B protein significantly increased at 10 days, decreased from 20 to 60 days, and then gradually elevated from 70 to 80 days after busulfan treatment. CONCLUSION: We revealed 190 significantly downregulated proteins in busulfan-treated mouse testes at 30 days and indicated that 70 days is the cut-off point of spermatogenic recovery for busulfan-treated mouse testis, increasing our understanding of this reproductive disorder model. An increased understanding of busulfan's toxic effect will help to prevent and treat reproductive diseases.",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2024.2442534
40110643,Toward a therapeutic relationship: A randomized control trial of the physical environment and client-centered communication in genetic counseling.,4/2025,0.703,"Genetic counselors routinely provide service in many environments, including counseling-type and medical-type rooms; in this study, counseling environments are characterized by office decor that facilitates discussion around a seated table, while medical environments include an exam table and separate seating. Outside of the genetic counseling context, manipulation of the environment can influence client comfort in disclosing personal information, well-being, and overall satisfaction with clinician communication. However, there is little known about how clients experience genetic counseling in one environment versus the other and how that might influence their evaluation of genetic counselor communication. To explore the extent to which the physical environment influences client perceptions, we video recorded two simulated sessions addressing the same genetic counseling topic with two contrasting styles of communication (more and less patient-centered) in front of a greenscreen background. Videos were digitally placed in counseling and medical environments such that the same verbal and nonverbal communication was presented in the two environments, creating a total of four videos (e.g., a 2 x 2 experimental design). Participants (N = 861) were randomly assigned to observe one of the four videos and respond as if they were the client in the video (e.g., as analog clients). Overall, participants rated the less patient-centered communication more favorably (p < 0.05 across variables), contrary to our expectations. Structural equation modeling revealed that perceptions of nonverbal communication mediated the relationship between communication style and perceptions of the counselor's encouragement of participation in the session and the therapeutic bond. Results offer insight into how the physical environment might influence communication in genetic counseling, illustrating new avenues for improving client-counselor communication in this context.",Journal of genetic counseling,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgc4.2013
39999766,Comprehensive genomic profiling can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.,4/2025,0.503,"BACKGROUND: The rate of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) varies, and adjuvant therapy treatment for residual cancer remains a challenge. The aim of our study was to assess the added value of FoundationOne(R)CDx (F1CDx) testing in the non-metastatic TNBC in predicting responses to NACT and disease outcomes. METHODS: Ninety-three eligible patients with stage II-III TNBC were treated with NACT without immunotherapy. Response to NACT was evaluated postoperatively. Comprehensive genomic profiling with NGS-based molecular test F1CDx was performed on diagnostic biopsies (N = 93). Hierarchical clustering and logistic regression were applied for data analysis. RESULTS: Genomic profiling and data clustering revealed heterogeneous genetic landscapes of TNBC with subsets displaying multilayered co-amplifications of oncogenes and overlapping changes in crucial signaling pathways. TP53 mutations were detected in 95 % of all TNBCs. BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were significant molecular factors in predicting favorable responses to NACT (OR = 0.09, p = 0.002), while CCNDs co-mutations with FGFs (OR = 13.4, p = 0.016) and PI3Ks family mutations in AR-positive cases (OR = 6.1, p = 0.008) - poor responses. Low tumor mutational burden (TMB) </= 3 (OR = 9.4, p = 0.009) was a significant factor for the disease progression after NACT. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that comprehensive CDx testing can be explored as a prognostic tool in early-stage TNBC to predict responses to NACT and disease progression. Based on these results, genomic analysis should be performed early in the patient journey, possibly guiding adjuvant treatment choices and participation in randomized clinical trials, mainly when pCR is not achieved, as the ultimate goal is improving patient outcomes.","Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2025.104423

The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the efficacy of HIFU ablation for UFs, assisting the preoperative selection of suitable patients with UFs. METHODS: This study collected data from 1,000 patients with UFs who underwent ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for multidimensional feature screening. Five machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural network, and gradient boosting decision tree were utilized to predict ablation efficacy. The efficacy was quantified by the non-perfused volume ratio (NPVR), which was classified into two categories: NPVR <80% and NPVR >/=80%. RESULTS: The XGBoost model proved to be the most effective, showing the highest AUC of 0.692 (95% CI: 0.622-0.762) in the testing data set. The four key predictors were T2 weighted image, the distance from ventral side of UFs to skin, platelet count, and contrast-enhanced T1 weighted image. CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning prediction model in this study showed significant potential for accurately predicting the preoperative efficacy of HIFU ablation for UFs. These insights were important for clinicians in the preoperative assessment and selection of patients, which could enhance the precision of treatment planning.","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2025.2473754

Accurate identification of antibiotic resistant strains is essential for the control of infection. In the present study, our goal is to leverage the whole-genome data of H. pylori to develop practical and interpretable machine learning (ML) models for comprehensive antibiotic resistance assessment. A total of 296 H. pylori isolates with genome-wide data were downloaded from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. By training ML models on feature sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms from SNP calling (SNPs-1), antibiotic-resistance SNP annotated by the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (SNPs-2), gene presence or absence (GPA), we generated predictive models for four antibiotics and multidrug-resistance (MDR). Among them, the models that combined SNPs-1, SNPs-2, and GPA data demonstrated the best performance, with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) consistently outperforming others. And then we utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the ML models. Furthermore, a free web application for the MDR model was deployed to the GitHub repository (https://H.pylori/MDR/App/). Our study demonstrated the promise of employing whole-genome data in conjunction with ML algorithms to forecast H. pylori antibiotic resistance.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a personalized prediction model for psoriasis relapse following the discontinuation of biologics. METHODS: This study enrolled patients who achieved remission following biologic therapy. Relapse predictors were identified using the Boruta algorithm combined with multivariate Cox regression. A nomogram and an online calculator were created to aid in the visualization and computation of outcomes. The model's performance was thoroughly assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area Under the Curve (AUC), C-statistics, calibration plots, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). RESULTS: The study included 597 patients, with 534 in the derivation cohort and 63 in the validation cohort. Anxiety, disease duration, prior biologic treatments, treatment duration, time to achieve PASI 75, and maximum PASI response were identified as influential factors for relapse and were incorporated into the model. Both internal and external evaluations indicate that the model exhibits good predictive accuracy.

40104981,Identifying liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B: an interpretable machine learning algorithm based on LSM.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a common cause of liver cirrhosis (LC), a condition associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Therefore, timely diagnosis of LC in CHB patients is crucial. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LC in CHB patients by integrating liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with traditional indicators. METHODS: The study participants were randomly divided into training and internal validation sets. Employing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest-recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) for feature selection, we developed both traditional logistic regression and five machine learning models (k-nearest neighbors, random forest (RF), artificial neural network, support vector machine and eXtreme Gradient Boosting). Performance evaluation included receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves and decision curve analysis. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was employed to improve the interpretability of the optimal model. RESULTS: We retrospectively included 1609 patients with CHB, among whom 470 were diagnosed with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on histological confirmation or clinical assessment, supported by characteristic findings on abdominal ultrasound and corroborative evidence such as thrombocytopenia, varices or imaging from CT/MRI. In the internal validation, the RF model achieved an accuracy above 0.80 and an AUC above 0.80, with outstanding calibration ability and clinical net benefit. Additionally, the model exhibited excellent predictive performance in an independent external validation set. The SHAP analysis indicated that LSM contributed the most to the model. The model still showed strong discriminative power when using only LSM or traditional indicators alone. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models, especially the RF model, can effectively identify LC in CHB patients. Integrating LSM with traditional indicators can enhance diagnostic performance.",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2025.2477294

Over 80% of AS cases in these regions are linked to dilation and curettage (D&C) procedures following pregnancy. The incidence of AS in patients with infertility and recurrent miscarriage can be as high as 10%, while the pregnancy rate in cases of moderate to severe adhesions can be as low as 34%. We aimed to establish a hysteroscopic artificial intelligence system using image-deep-learning algorithms for fertility assessment. METHODS: This diagnostic study included 555 cases with 4922 hysteroscopic images from a Chinese intrauterine adhesions cohort clinical database (NCT05381376). The study evaluated two image-deep-learning algorithms' effectiveness in predicting pregnancy within one year, using AUCs and decision curve analysis. The models' performance was evaluated for two-year prediction via concordance index and cumulative time-dependent ROC. A quantifiable visualization panel of the system was established. RESULTS: The proportional hazard CNN system accurately predicted conception, with AUCs of 0.982, 0.992, and 0.990 in three randomly assigned datasets, superior to the InceptionV3 framework, and achieved a net benefit of 69.4% for subfertility assessment. The system fitted well with c-indexes of 0.920-0.940 and was time-stable. The quantifiable visualization panel displayed four intrauterine pathologies intuitively. The performance was comparable to senior hysteroscopists, with a kappa value of 0.84-0.89.

METHODS: Adult CKD patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention at the Second Xiangya Hospital (2015-2021) were enrolled. The patients were divided into a derivation cohort and a validation cohort based on their admission dates. The primary outcome was the development of PC-AKI. The random forest algorithm was used to identify the most influential predictors of PC-AKI. Six machine learning algorithms were used to construct predictive models for PC-AKI. Model 1 included only preoperative variables, whereas Model 2 included both preoperative and intraoperative variables. The Mehran score was included in the comparison as a classic postoperative predictive model for PC-AKI. RESULTS: Among the 989 CKD patients enrolled, 125 (12.6%) developed PC-AKI. In the validation cohort, deep neural network (DNN) outperformed other machine learning models with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.733 (95% CI 0.654-0.812) for Model 1 and 0.770 (95% CI 0.695-0.845) for Model 2. Furthermore, Model 2 showed better performance compared to the Mehran score (AUROC 0.631, 95% CI 0.538-0.724). The SHapley Additive exPlanations method provided interpretability for the DNN models.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a previous random clinical trial aiming to evaluate the preventive effects of PrEP on new HIV infection in MSM. During 2013-2015, 1455 HIV-negative MSM were enrolled. Participants were divided into treatment group and control group and regularly followed up until they seroconverted to HIV positive or until the 2-year endpoint reached. Five machine-learning approaches were applied to predict the risk of HIV infection. Model performance was evaluated using Harrel's C-index and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and validated in an external validation cohort. To explain this model, shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values were calculated and visualized. RESULTS: During the observation period, 102 MSM developed HIV infection. Thirteen parameters are selected to construct the model. The random survival forest model showed the best performance in the validation cohort, with a C-index of 0.7013, and could significantly categorize MSM into three groups. Our model indicated that MSM with younger age, receptive anal intercourse, and multiple male sexual partners had an increased risk of HIV infection, and those with higher AIDS knowledge scores had a lower risk.

Nonetheless, the interplay between the functional capacity of gut microbiota and their host remains elusive for DKD. This study aims to elucidate the functional capability of gut microbiota to affect kidney function of DKD patients. A total of 990 subjects were enrolled consisting of a control group (n = 455), a type 2 diabetes mellitus group (DM, n = 204), a DKD group (n = 182) and a chronic kidney disease group (CKD, n = 149). Full-length sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from stool DNA was conducted. Three findings are pinpointed. Firstly, new types of microbiota biomarkers have been created using a machine-learning (ML) method, namely relative abundance of a microbe, presence or absence of a microbe, and the hierarchy ratio between two different taxonomies. Four different panels of features were selected to be analyzed: (i) DM vs. Control, (ii) DKD vs. DM, (iii) DKD vs. CKD, and (iv) CKD vs. Control. These had accuracy rates between 0.72 and 0.78 and areas under curve between 0.79 and 0.86. Secondly, 13 gut microbiota biomarkers, which are strongly correlated with anthropometric, metabolic and/or renal indexes, concomitantly identified by the ML algorithm and the differential abundance method were highly discriminatory. Finally, the predicted functional capability of a DKD-specific biomarker, Gemmiger spp. is enriched in carbohydrate metabolism and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis. Coincidentally, the circulating levels of various BCAAs (L-valine, L-leucine and L-isoleucine) and their precursor, L-glutamate, are significantly increased in DM and DKD patients, which suggests that, when hyperglycemia is present, there has been alterations in various interconnected pathways associated with glycolysis, pyruvate fermentation and BCAA biosynthesis.

Candidate developability, such as biophysical properties that affect the formulation of the molecule into a product, is usually evaluated only toward the end of the drug development pipeline. The ability to evaluate developability properties early in the process of antibody therapeutic development could accelerate the timeline from discovery to clinic and save considerable resources. In silico predictive approaches, such as machine learning models, which map molecular features to predictions of developability properties could offer a cost-effective and high-throughput alternative to experiments for antibody developability assessment. We developed a computational framework, PROPERMAB (PROPERties of Monoclonal AntiBodies), for large-scale and efficient in silico prediction of developability properties for monoclonal antibodies, using custom molecular features and machine learning modeling. We demonstrate the power of PROPERMAB by using it to develop models to predict antibody hydrophobic interaction chromatography retention time and high-concentration viscosity.

This study investigates modified lipid nanoparticles (LNP) for mRNA delivery to hyperactivated microglia, particularly those with pro-inflammatory characteristics, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers. We developed and screened a library of 216 LNP formulations with varying lipid compositions, N/P ratios, and hyaluronic acid (HA) modifications. The transfection efficiency of eGFP mRNA was assessed in the BV-2 murine microglia cell line under different immunological states, including resting and activated conditions (LPS-activated and IL4/IL13-activated). ML-guided morphometric analysis tracked the phenotypes of various microglia subtypes before and after transfection. Four supervised ML classifiers were investigated to predict transfection efficiency and phenotypic changes based on LNP design parameters. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network emerged as the best-performing model, achieving weighted F1-scores >/=0.8. While it accurately predicted responses from LPS-activated and resting cells, it struggled with IL4/IL13-activated cells. The MLP model was validated by predicting the performance of four unseen LNP formulations delivering eGFP mRNA to LPS-activated BV2 cells. HA-LNP2 emerged as optimal formulation for delivering target IL10 mRNA, effectively suppressing inflammatory phenotypes, evidenced by shifts in cell morphology, increased IL10 expression, and reduced TNF-alpha levels. We also evaluated HA-LNP2 on LPS-activated human iPSC-derived microglia, confirming its efficacy in modulating inflammatory responses.

Existing research has found that CPTSD symptoms are closely associated with childhood maltreatment; however, researchers debate whether CPTSD symptoms are predominantly influenced by a specific type of childhood maltreatment or the combined influence of multiple maltreatment types.Objective: (1) Examines the impact of childhood maltreatment on CPTSD symptoms, specifically exploring whether specific types of maltreatment or the cumulative exposure to multiple types of maltreatment play a predominant role. (2) Investigates the role of positive psychological traits in this relationship, assessing whether these traits serve as protective factors or are outcomes of the negative psychological consequences of maltreatment.Methods: A sample of 1894 adolescents (Mage = 13.88; SD = 1.00) from a chronically impoverished rural area in China completed the International Trauma Questionnaire - Child and Adolescent Version for CPTSD symptoms, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form for childhood maltreatment types. Positive psychological traits, including mindfulness, self-compassion, and gratitude, were measured using the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), the Self-Compassion Scale - Short Form, and the Gratitude Questionnaire. We addressed the research question using explainable machine learning methods, with SHAP enhancing model interpretability.Results: The findings indicate that emotional abuse is the most effective predictor of CPTSD symptoms, with individuals who experienced emotional abuse showing higher rates of other forms of maltreatment. Among positive psychological traits, mindfulness contributes the most, followed by self-compassion, while gratitude shows no significant association with CPTSD symptoms. Additionally, individuals with poor positive psychological traits are more likely to have experienced maltreatment, whereas those with higher positive traits are less exposed to abuse.Conclusions: Emotional abuse and low levels of positive psychological traits are strongly associated with CPTSD symptoms in adolescents from impoverished areas, with positive traits showing limited buffering effects against maltreatment.",European journal of psychotraumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2025.2455800
39992712,Deep learning methods for clinical workflow phase-based prediction of procedure duration: a benchmark study.,12/2025,0.553,"This study evaluates the performance of deep learning models in the prediction of the end time of procedures performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (cath lab). We employed only the clinical phases derived from video analysis as input to the algorithms. Our results show that InceptionTime and LSTM-FCN yielded the most accurate predictions. InceptionTime achieves Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values below 5 min and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) under 6% at 60-s sampling intervals. In contrast, LSTM with attention mechanism and standard LSTM models have higher error rates, indicating challenges in handling both long-term and short-term dependencies. CNN-based models, especially InceptionTime, excel at feature extraction across different scales, making them effective for time-series predictions. We also analyzed training and testing times. CNN models, despite higher computational costs, significantly reduce prediction errors. The Transformer model has the fastest inference time, making it ideal for real-time applications. An ensemble model derived by averaging the two best performing algorithms reported low MAE and SMAPE, although needing longer training. Future research should validate these findings across different procedural contexts and explore ways to optimize training times without losing accuracy.

Traditional glucose tolerance tests lack the ability to identify the risk of GDM in early pregnancy, hindering effective prevention and timely intervention during the initial stages. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to pinpoint potential risk factors for GDM and develop an early GDM risk prediction model using neural networks to facilitate GDM screening in early pregnancy. METHODS: Initially, we employed statistical tests and models, including univariate and multivariate logistic regression, to identify 14 potential risk factors. Subsequently, we applied various resampling techniques alongside a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Finally, we evaluated and compared the classification performances of the constructed models using various metric indicators. RESULTS: As a result, we identified several factors in early pregnancy significantly associated with GDM (p < 0.05), including BMI, age of menarche, age, higher education, folic acid supplementation, family history of diabetes mellitus, HGB, WBC, PLT, Scr, HBsAg, ALT, ALB, and TBIL. Employing the multivariate logistic model as the baseline achieved an accuracy and AUC of 0.777. In comparison, the MLP-based model using NearMiss exhibited strong predictive performance, achieving scores of 0.943 in AUC and 0.884 in accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we proposed an innovative interpretable early GDM risk prediction model based on MLP. This model is designed to offer assistance in estimating the risk of GDM in early pregnancy, enabling proactive prevention and timely intervention.",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2025.2470317

39890587,Digital health competences and AI beliefs as conditions for the practice of evidence-based medicine: a study of prospective physicians in Canada.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) has become pivotal in enhancing medical care and patient outcomes. With the diffusion of innovation in healthcare organizations, EBM can be expected to depend on medical professionals' competences with digital health (dHealth) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the effect of dHealth competences and perceptions of AI on the adoption of EBM among prospective physicians. By focusing on dHealth and AI technologies, the study seeks to inform the redesign of medical curricula to better prepare students for the demands of evidence-based medical practice. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered online to students at the University of Montreal's medical school, which has approximately 1,400 enrolled students. The survey included questions on students' dHealth competences, perceptions of AI, and their practice of EBM. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed data from 177 respondents to test our research model. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that medical students possess foundational knowledge competences of dHealth technologies and perceive AI to play an important role in the future of medicine. Yet, their experiential competences with dHealth technologies are limited. Our findings reveal that experiential dHealth competences are significantly related to the practice of EBM (beta = 0.42, p < 0.001), as well as students' perceptions of the role of AI in the future of medicine (beta = 0.39, p < 0.001), which, in turn, also affect EBM (beta = 0.19, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the necessity of enhancing students' competences related to dHealth and considering their perceptions of the role of AI in the medical profession. In particular, the low levels of experiential dHealth competences highlight a promising starting point for training future physicians while simultaneously strengthening their practice of EBM. Accordingly, we suggest revising medical curricula to focus on providing students with practical experiences with dHealth and AI technologies.",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2025.2459910

However, ART's efficacy is limited by significant financial cost and physical discomfort. The aim of this study is to build Machine learning (ML) decision-support models to predict the optimal range of embryo numbers to transfer, using data from infertile couples identified through literature reviews. Binary classification models were developed to classify cases into two groups: those transferring two or fewer embryos and those transferring three or four. Four popular ML algorithms were used, including random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), considering seven criteria: the woman's age, sperm origin, the developmental qualities of four potential embryos, infertility duration, assessment of the woman, morphological qualities of the four best embryos on the day of transfer, and number of oocytes extracted. The stratified 3-fold cross-validation results show that the SVM model obtained the highest average accuracy (95.83%) and demonstrated the best overall performance, closely followed by the ANN and LR models with an average accuracy equal to 91.67%. The RF model achieved a slightly lower average accuracy (88.89%), which demonstrated the lowest variability. Testing on a new dataset revealed all models performed well, with ANN and SVM models classified all test set instances correctly, while the RF and LR models achieved 91.68% accuracy.

However, the discriminative or calibration capacity of the currently employed models are limited. We set out to apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to create a highly predictive risk stratification indicator, applicable to the UK's transplant selection process. Methodology: Pre-transplant characteristics from 12,661 live-donor kidney transplants (performed between 2007 and 2022) from the United Kingdom Transplant Registry database were analyzed. The transplants were randomly divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Death-censored graft survival was the primary performance indicator. We experimented with four machine learning (ML) models assessed for calibration and discrimination [integrated Brier score (IBS) and Harrell's concordance index]. We assessed the potential clinical utility using decision curve analysis. Results: XGBoost demonstrated the best discriminative performance for survival (area under the curve = 0.73, 0.74, and 0.75 at 3, 7, and 10 years post-transplant, respectively). The concordance index was 0.72. The calibration process was adequate, as evidenced by the IBS score of 0.09. Conclusion: By evaluating possible donor-recipient pairs based on graft survival, the AI-based UK Live-Donor Kidney Transplant Outcome Prediction has the potential to enhance choices for the best live-donor selection.

However, the work required for upstream protein expression and downstream purification development often conflicts with timeline pressures and material constraints, limiting the number of molecules and process conditions that can reasonably be assessed. Recently, high-throughput batch-binding screen data along with improved molecular descriptors have enabled development of robust quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models that predict monoclonal antibody chromatographic binding behavior from the amino acid sequence. Here, we describe a QSPR strategy for in silico monoclonal antibody purification process fit assessment. Principal Component Analysis is applied to extract a one-dimensional basis for comparison of molecular chromatographic binding behavior from multi-dimensional high-throughput batch-binding screen data. Kernel Ridge Regression is used to predict the first principal component for new molecular sequences. This workflow is demonstrated with a set of 97 monoclonal antibodies for five chromatography resins in two salt types across a range of pH and salt concentrations. Model development benchmarks four descriptor sets from biophysical structural models and protein language models. The investigation illustrates the value QSPR models can provide to purification process fit assessment, and selection of resins and operating conditions from sequence alone.",mAbs,https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2024.2439988

We investigated the predictive ability of several ML models for the development of hypertension. METHODS: A total of 15 965 Japanese participants (men/women: 9,466/6,499, mean age: 45 years) who received annual health examinations were randomly divided into a training group (70%, n = 11,175) and a test group (30%, n = 4,790). The predictive abilities of 58 candidates including fatty liver index (FLI), which is calculated by using body mass index, waist circumference and levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and triglycerides, were investigated by statistics analogous to the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic curve analyses using ML models including logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, extreme gradient boosting and artificial neural network. RESULTS: During a 10-year period (mean period: 6.1 years), 2,132 subjects (19.1%) in the training group and 917 subjects (19.1%) in the test group had new onset of hypertension. Among the 58 parameters, systolic blood pressure, age and FLI were identified as important candidates by random forest feature selection with 10-fold cross-validation. The AUCs of ML models were 0.765-0.825, and discriminatory capacity was significantly improved in the artificial neural network model compared to that in the logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The development of hypertension can be simply and accurately predicted by each ML model using systolic blood pressure, age and FLI as selected features.

Disulfidptosis, a recently discovered programmed cell death triggered by disulphide stress, presents a fresh avenue for therapeutic exploration. This research examines disulfidptosis-related long noncoding RNAs (DRLs) in gastric cancer, with the goal of leveraging these lncRNAs as potential markers to enhance patient outcomes and treatment approaches. Comprehensive genomic and clinical data from stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, a prognostic model was devised incorporating five key DRLs to forecast survival rates. The effectiveness of this model was validated using Kaplan-Meier survival plots, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and extensive functional enrichment studies. The importance of select lncRNAs and the expression variability of genes tied to disulfidptosis were validated via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot tests, establishing a solid foundation for their prognostic utility. Analyses of functional enrichment and tumour mutation burden highlighted the biological importance of these DRLs, connecting them to critical cancer pathways and immune responses.

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of LungFlag implementation in the Spanish setting for the identification of individuals at high-risk of NSCLC. METHODS: A model combining a decision-tree with a Markov model was adapted to the Spanish setting to calculate health outcomes and costs over a lifetime horizon, comparing two hypothetical scenarios: screening with LungFlag versus non-screening, and screening with LungFlag versus screening the entire population meeting 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. Model inputs were obtained from the literature and the clinical practice of a multidisciplinary expert panel. Only direct costs (euroof 2023), obtained from local sources, were considered. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of our results. RESULTS: A cohort of 3,835,128 individuals meeting 2013 USPSTF criteria would require 2,147,672 LDCTs scans. However, using LungFlag would only require 232,120 LDCTs scans. Cost-effectiveness results showed that LungFlag was dominant versus non-screening scenario, and outperformed the scenario where the entire population were screened since the observed loss of effectiveness (-224,031 life years [LYs] and -97,612 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) was largely offset by the significant cost savings provided (euro7,053 million). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for this strategy of screening the whole population versus using LungFlag was euro72,000/QALY, showing that LungFlag is cost-effective. Various were described, such as the source of the efficacy or adherence rates, and other limitations inherent to cost-effectiveness analyses.

39970782,Emerging applications of fluorescence excitation-emission matrix with machine learning for water quality monitoring: A systematic review.,6/2025,0.674,"Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy is increasingly utilized in water quality monitoring due to its rapid, sensitive, and non-destructive measurement capabilities. The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with FEEM offers a powerful approach to enhance data interpretation and improve monitoring efficiency. This review systematically examines the application of ML-FEEM in urban water systems across three primary tasks of ML: classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Contributed by the effectiveness of ML in nonlinear and high dimensional data analysis, ML-FEEM achieved superior accuracy and efficiency in pollutant qualification and quantification. The fluorescence features extracted through ML are more representative and hold potential for generating new FEEM samples. Additionally, the rich visualization capabilities of ML-FEEM facilitate the exploration of the migration and transformation of dissolved organic matter in water. This review underscores the importance of leveraging the latest ML advancements to uncover hidden information within FEEM data, and advocates for the use of pattern recognition methods, represented by self-organizing map, to further elucidate the behavior of pollutants in aquatic environments. Despite notable advancements, several issues require careful consideration, including the portable or online setups for FEEM collection, the standardized pretreatment processes for FEEM analysis, and the smart feedback of long-term FEEM governance.",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2025.123281
39961738,Artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacovigilance: A systematic review on predicting adverse drug reactions (ADR) in hospitalized patients.,6/2025,0.674,"INTRODUCTION: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) significantly impact healthcare systems, leading to increased hospitalization rates and costs. With the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, machine learning (ML) models offer promising solutions for ADR prediction. However, comprehensive evaluations of these models remain limited. METHODS: This systematic review synthesized findings from 13 studies that utilized various ML algorithms (regression-based, flexible, and ensemble models) to predict ADRs using data such as patient demographics, laboratory values, and comorbidities. Meta-analysis was conducted to assess the pooled sensitivity and specificity of the models, and a co-authorship and keyword analysis was performed to examine collaborative networks within the field. RESULTS: The included studies primarily focused on model development (77 %), with only 23 % incorporating external validation, raising concerns about generalizability across clinical contexts. Meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 78.1 % and 70.6 % for development-only studies, while studies with external validation achieved higher sensitivity (81.5 %) and specificity (79.5 %). Co-authorship analysis identified 67 contributors across eight collaboration clusters, indicating a specialized but emerging research field. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the need for multifactorial models that integrate diverse predictors to improve the performance and reliability of ML-based ADR prediction. Addressing these limitations through rigorous model development and validation processes could enhance the clinical applicability of AI-driven pharmacovigilance, ultimately advancing patient safety and healthcare outcomes.",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2025.02.008
39789882,Long-term impact of molecular epidemiology shifts of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on severity and mortality of bloodstream infection.,12/2025,0.553,"A 2019 nationwide study in Japan revealed the predominant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) types in bloodstream infections (BSIs) to be sequence type (ST)8-carrying SCCmec type IV (ST8-MRSA-IV) and clonal complex 1-carrying SCCmec type IV (CC1-MRSA-IV). However, detailed patient characteristics and how these MRSA types evolve over time remain largely unknown. In this long-term single-center study, MRSA strains isolated from blood cultures at Nagasaki University Hospital from 2012 to 2019 were sequenced and analyzed. Additionally, we compared the SCCmec types and patient characteristics identified in this study with previous data from our hospital spanning 2003-2007 and 2008-2011. Over this 16-year period, SCCmec type II decreased significantly from 79.2% to 15.5%, while type IV increased from 18.2% to 65.5%. This shift in SCCmec types was associated with notable changes in severity and outcomes; the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score decreased from 5.8 to 3.1; in-hospital mortality declined from 39.8% to 15.5%. In contrast, no significant changes in patient demographics, such as age, sex, or underlying diseases, were observed. Between 2012 and 2019, the major combinations of SCCmec type and sequence type were ST8-MRSA-IV, ST8-MRSA-I, CC1-MRSA-IV, and ST5-MRSA-II. Additionally, ST8-MRSA-IV was divided into CA-MRSA/J, t5071-ST8-MRSA-IV, and USA300-like clone based on the results of molecular analysis. These major combinations showed similar drug resistance patterns, molecular characteristics, and phylogenetic features to those identified in nationwide surveillance. This study highlights the evolving nature of MRSA types in bloodstream infections, correlating with improved patient outcomes over time.",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2024.2449085

Several sequence types of this serotype have been identified globally, including those exhibiting both high virulence potential and antimicrobial resistance profiles. This systematic review presents the global distribution of clones of pneumococcal serotype 1, describing their circulating patterns in various regions in the world. A database search was conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using keywords related to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 1. The inclusion criteria entailed peer-reviewed studies published in English describing the utilization of at least one molecular genotyping tool to identify S. pneumoniae serotype 1 clones based on their sequence types. Data extracted were managed and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 365 (Version 2108). Forty-three studies were finally included in the systematic review. A total of 103 MLST serotype 1 sequence types were identified in 48 countries. These clones were widely reported to be associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases. Globally, ST217 and ST306 clonal complexes (CC217 and CC306) were the predominant lineages of serotype 1 sequence types, exhibiting distinct continental distribution patterns. CC217, characterized by ST217, ST303, ST612, ST618, and ST3081, was predominant in Africa and Asia. ST306 clonal complex, which is grouped into ST306, ST304, and ST227 were mostly found in Europe, Oceania, North America, and some countries in South America. ST615 was predominant in Chile, Peru, and Argentina. The hypervirulence nature of serotype 1, coupled with its complex genetic diversity, poses a significant public health threat.

There is however insufficient knowledge regarding the molecular epidemiology of Shigella strains producing beta-lactamases in Africa. This systematic review investigated the scientific literature on the molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemases producing Shigella in Africa. METHODS: Papers published in English and French from African countries on the molecular epidemiology of ESBL and carbapenemase producing Shigella from January 1999 to July 5, 2024 were reviewed. An extensive literature search was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, African Journals Online (AJOL) and Google scholar using specific keywords. The meta-analysis and forest plots of Shigella species, ESBL and carbapenemases genes were done using the comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. All data were analyzed using a binary random-effects model by the DerSimonian-Laird method at a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Out of the 583 research articles, only 18 (3.1%) articles representing eleven countries were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of ESBL and Carbapenem Resistant (CR)-producing Shigella was estimated as 41.2% (95% CI: 22.8-62.4; I(2) = 93.7%, p < 0.05). The leading ESBL and CR-producing Shigella species reported in this review was Shigella flexneri, 34.5% (95% CI: 16.6-58.2; I(2) = 94.9%, p < 0.05). ESBL and CR-producing Shigella sonnei was the least reported with estimated prevalence of 6.7% (95% CI: 3.4-13.2; I(2) = 80.7%, p < 0.05). In this review, bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1), and bla(CTX-M) were the most prevalent genes in Africa with prevalence of 25.9% (95% CI: 13.9-43.2; I(2) = 90.9%, p < 0.05), 25.7% (95% CI: 14.9-43.0; I(2) = 93.7%, p < 0.05), and 10.8% (95% CI: 4.5-23.4; I(2) = 85.6%, p < 0.05) respectively. The prevalence of Carbapenemases genes on the other hand was low, reported as 0.8% (95% CI: 0.2-10.3; I(2) = 51.4%; p < 0.05) for bla(NDM), 1.1% for bla(KPC), and 0.5% for bla(IMP). CONCLUSION: This study highlighted Shigella flexneri as the most prevalent ESBL and CR-producing Shigella species found in various African countries. The findings from this review indicate bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1) and bla(CTX-M) as the most prevalent genes in Africa while carbapenemases are least prevalent. The findings from the study suggest that ESBL and CR-producing Shigella pose a significant public health threat in Africa. Effective antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance strategies are needed to improve the management and treatment of Shigella infections in Africa.",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-024-10266-7
39776060,Patient and Public Involvement in Pharmacoepidemiological Research: An Environmental Scan of an Emerging Area.,1/2025,0.625,"BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research is required to improve the relevance, feasibility, and interpretability. However, research on PPIs in pharmacoepidemiology (PE) is still limited. This study aimed to provide an overview of PPI implementation in pharmacoepidemiology through an environmental scan. METHODS: The environmental scan combined systematic reviews and expert interviews. A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023, to identify PE studies in which PPIs were mentioned. An additional review covered British Medical Journal's (BMJ) original articles from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2023, via a similar method. In parallel, a cross-sectional study was conducted with a standardized questionnaire for French PE research teams, involving interviews via videoconference. RESULTS: We identified 3615 references for screening, among which 232 were selected for full-text screening. However, no studies have reported the use of PPIs in PE studies. The additional BMJ review identified 1058 references, 74 of which met the full-text selection criteria, and eight were included. Of 13 French PE research teams surveyed, three had prior PPI experience, and 12 affirmed the relevance of PPI in PE. The respondents identified barriers such as PE's complexity (n = 9). They suggested training for patients (n = 9) and collaboration with specialist teams (n = 5) to facilitate PPI.

Persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) have been suggested in the development of CC. Although prophylactic vaccines are available for the prevention of prevalent hr-HPV types, intra-type variations exist within a particular HPV type that has varying oncogenic potential as well as the mechanism of pathogenicity and varying neutralization by antibodies. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review to determine the distribution of HPV intra-typic variations in different geographical locations of India and their reported implications. Methods Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to retrieve relevant articles from the standard databases using appropriate keywords. Consequently, 17 articles were included in the current review after screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results The majority of articles included in this review reported variations within the HPV16 E6 gene, followed by the L1 and E7 genes. Analysis of available data indicated the differential regional distribution of some variations. These variations have also been reported to impact the biological functions of various viral proteins. Interpretation & conclusions The distribution of lineages varied with the different genomic regions sequenced. Additionally, there were certain unique and common variations in the HPV genome with respect to geographical regions. Hence, we suggest the identification of region-specific variations for the development of diagnostic and prognostic interventions.",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.25259/ijmr_212_24
39400654,Molecular Epidemiology and AMR Perspective of Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,12/2024,0.616,"INTRODUCTION: Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) persistently challenges public health in Africa, contributing substantially to the diarrhoeal disease burden. This systematic review and meta-analysis illuminate the distribution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of DEC pathotypes across the continent. METHODS: The review selectively focused on pathotype-specific studies reporting prevalence and/or AMR of human-derived DEC pathotypes from African nations, excluding data from extra-intestinal, animal, and environmental sources and studies focused on drug and mechanism experiments. Pertinent studies were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, and EBSCOhost, processed with Covidence, and screened in alignment with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: The reviewed studies were predominantly hospital-based (80%) and paediatric-focused (91%), with a meagre 4.4% documenting DEC outbreaks. Seven DEC pathotypes were discerned, with Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) being notably prevalent (43%, 95% CI 30-55%) and Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) least prevalent (24%, 95% CI 17-32%). Identified non-susceptibilities were noted against essential antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin, while instances of carbapenem and Extended-Spectrum ss-Lactamase (ESBL) resistance were scarce. CONCLUSION: Despite sporadic data on DEC prevalence and AMR in Africa, particularly in community settings, a palpable gap remains in real-time outbreak surveillance and comprehensive data documentation. Augmenting surveillance and embracing advancements in molecular/genomic characterisation techniques are crucial to precisely discerning DEC's actual impact and resistance continuum in Africa.",Journal of epidemiology and global health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s44197-024-00301-w

We conducted a systematic review to update, and extend, the previous review by Bos et al. (2015), by performing literature searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, and EMBASE. Search queries included every DSM-disorder, ATC-listed psychotropic medication, and multiple search-terms for ESM. Studies included medicated psychiatric patients who filled-out ambulatory prompts >/=2/day. Templates served to distil research themes. The majority of the 79 included studies involved substance use- (n = 47), mood- (n = 17), and psychotic disorders (n = 11). Less studied were anxiety disorders and PTSD (n = 3), and ADHD (n = 1).

It is extensively utilized in dispensing granules, classical prescriptions, and herbal formulas to treat various conditions, including cough, infection, phlegm, nausea, asthma, and inflammation. Despite numerous studies on PR and its classical prescriptions over recent decades, a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence regarding its multifunctional roles and therapeutic potential is lacking. This review aims to address this gap by examining emerging evidence from metabonomics, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, while exploring potential trends and prospects for future research. A systematic literature search was conducted across six electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, to identify relevant articles on PR published until March 2023. PR contains 107 compounds with diverse pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, immune regulatory, anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-asthma, antitussive and expectorant, antioxidant, anti-obesity, anti-atherosclerosis, anti-microbial, emetic and anti-emetic, anti-convulsant and anti-epileptic, sedative and hypnotic, learning and memory enhancement, and anti-depressant effects. Metabonomic studies suggest that raw PR may exhibit cardiotoxicity and pregnancy toxicity while showing no apparent hepatorenal toxicity. However, limited pharmacokinetic investigations on PR constrain its clinical translation. Furthermore, clinical safety data on PR is scarce, with only four clinical trials assessing its positive effects in pediatric epilepsy, nausea and vomiting, soft tissue injury, and chronic sinus tract.

40119395,Towards mHealth applications for pet animal owners: a comprehensive literature review of requirements.,3/2025,0.643,"BACKGROUND: Veterinarians experience high workloads and stress levels in their daily work, of which they need to be relieved as much as possible. The general public is showing great interest in digital health services. At the same time, animal owners and veterinarians are seeing telehealth services as particularly positive for triage aspects in veterinary medicine. One approach to support veterinarians may be to enable pet owners to, for instance, make informed decisions on how urgent their animal needs to be examined by a veterinary professional through an mHealth application. For this, stakeholder requirements need to be gathered, which should provide as a starting point for the development of such a decision support system. RESULTS: 955 publications were screened, resulting in the extraction of 10 requirements to mHealth applications for animal owners from 13 publications. Most frequently mentioned aspects were: ensuring complete information input by the user (6 mentions) and displaying a disclaimer about application limitations prominently (5 mentions). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the extracted requirements focus on the design of the human-computer interface, revealing this as a crucial point to such applications, especially in guiding animal owners through information and ensuring understanding, particularly of application limitations. However, the small number of included publications shows that primary research in this field, in general, and in this specific topic in particular, is needed in order to fully reflect the requirements for an mHealth application to help animal owners decide on their animal's need to be examined by a veterinary professional.",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-025-04658-3

For patients with severe and treatment-resistant psychotic disorders, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a potentially effective treatment. Data regarding the use of ECT in forensic psychiatry are scarce. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the use of ECT in forensic psychiatry. Three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were searched for publications since 1980. Peer-reviewed articles describing patients who underwent ECT treatment in the context of forensic psychiatry were included when a treatment outcome was reported. We identified 5 case reports and 1 case series comprising 13 patients treated with ECT in forensic settings. The quality of evidence was poor accompanied by a considerable risk of bias. Patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n = 10) or depression with psychotic features (n = 3). Eleven patients (84.6%) were described as responders in terms of symptom improvement associated with a reduction of aggressive behavior and improved functioning. At least 3 patients were able to return to community settings. Despite the very limited evidence base, our review suggests that patients in forensic hospitals may benefit from ECT, but more systematic and higher-quality evidence is urgently needed. In addition to prospective, controlled observational studies, a qualitative view focusing on patients' perspectives in this specific setting is of particular importance.",The journal of ECT,https://doi.org/10.1097/YCT.0000000000001041
39046764,Review of EmPATH Units for Behavioral Health Casualties in Prolonged Field Care Environments.,2/2025,0.634,"INTRODUCTION: Psychiatric conditions are one of the leading non-battle injury diseases resulting in medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) from combat environments. The challenge of limited MEDEVAC capability necessitating prolonged field care in future large-scale combat operations must be addressed. Therefore, a robust program is needed to address frontline care of behavioral health (BH), maximizing service members returning to duty and minimizing MEDEVAC. This review summarizes the literature on the impacts of the Emergency Psychiatric Assessment, Treatment, and Healing (EmPATH) Unit program as a solution to the challenges of treating behavioral health in future wars. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search and review, and a non-systematic literature critique. We then used the Johns Hopkins evidence appraisal tool to appraise the strength and quality of the evidence. The following electronic databases were utilized for the search: Google Scholar, Embase, CINAHL, and PubMed. Search terms included: included ""EmPATH,"" ""prolonged field care,"" and ""operational,"" alone and combined. RESULTS: The literature review found that the EmPATH unit, a recently developed civilian hospital-based program, can work with higher acuity psychiatric crisis patients who would otherwise be admitted to an inpatient unit, showing promising results in avoiding the need for inpatient hospitalization. EmPATH units help decrease hospitalization rates, reduce restraints and violence, and shorten the patients' boarding time in a holding area. Such findings support the use of the EmPATH unit as a tactic for prolonged field care of psychiatric patients in a combat operational environment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first literature review to consider EmPATH units for psychiatric prolonged field care based on its advantages demonstrated in the civilian sector. Studies have yet to be done on EmPATH units' usefulness in the military, showing a knowledge gap in current evidence supporting its suitability. Thus, this review recommends further studies of EmPATH units in military settings, especially prolonged field care environments.",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usae362
39110192,Identifying studies examining the validity of instruments for use as outcome measures in child and adolescent forensic mental health services: a systematic review.,2/2025,0.634,"BACKGROUND: Outcome measurement in child and adolescent forensic mental health services can support service improvement, research, and patient progress evaluation. This systematic review aimed to identify studies which validate structured instruments available for use as outcome measures in the child and adolescent forensic mental health service cohort and assess the quality of these studies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were identified by searching six online databases in November 2023. The quality and risk of bias of each study meeting inclusion criteria was independently assessed by two authors using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. Results were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: A total of eight studies were identified which met inclusion criteria. These looked at six instruments which primarily focused on outcome measures in the areas of treatment motivation, level of functioning, psychiatric symptoms, care needs and response to social situations. Papers scored between 17/40 and 30/40 on the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool. Studies were rated as low (n = 1), moderate (n = 6), high (n = 1) or very high quality (n = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large number of structured instruments potentially available, evidence for their use as outcome measures in child and adolescent forensic mental health services is limited. Future research should aim to validate current structured instruments for use in the forensic child and adolescent setting, with consideration of whether new instruments should be developed specifically for this group. Such instruments should be developed with both young people as service users and professionals who will be utilising the instrument in mind.",European child & adolescent psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-024-02514-7
39499883,The Effect of Repeated Review of Course Content on Medium- and Long-Term Retention in an Elective Veterinary Cardiology Course.,10/2024,0.65,"Assessment in veterinary medicine is challenging given the high volume of material and high cognitive load. Differing opinions exist regarding the utility of comprehensive final examinations in veterinary courses. A mixed-methods prospective randomized trial was undertaken with veterinary students (n = 47) in an elective cardiology course. All students received identical content, which was presented through weekly in-class lectures (eight total lessons). They were given access to four different formats of study aids and completed quizzes of content knowledge within 1 week of each lesson. For the cumulative final examination (post-test), students were explicitly instructed to study only for four out of the eight lessons. Students then completed a delayed post-test 3-6 months after completion of the course. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in the form of in-depth pre- and post-course surveys. Overall, studying a particular lesson for the post-test resulted in higher scores for six out of eight lessons in the post-test (p < .05) but did not result in significantly higher scores for any lesson in the delayed post-test. Time spent studying for individual quizzes, as well as other measures of study habits, decreased significantly throughout the semester. Among study aids, student preference was highest for instructor-provided graphic organizers, and this preference persisted across the semester with a shift away from instructor-provided outlines over time (p = .043). Free-text survey responses showed that students had realistic expectations for the impact of studying for the post-test and appreciated exposure to a variety of study aid formats. In an elective veterinary cardiology course, review of material prior to a cumulative final examination led to improved short-term performance but no difference in retention 3-6 months later.",Journal of veterinary medical education,https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme-2023-0088
39350226,The efficacy of simulation-based learning versus non-simulation-based learning in endocrinology education: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,9/2024,0.593,"BACKGROUND: Simulation-Based Learning (SBL) is increasingly adopted in medical education across various specialties, employing realistic simulations to significantly enhance learning experiences. However, a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness specifically in endocrinology has not yet been conducted. The study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the impact of SBL versus Non-Simulation-Based Learning (NSBL) on knowledge acquisition, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning among endocrinology trainees. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Weipu, and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) until March 2024. We included randomized controlled trials comparing SBL to NSBL in endocrinology education. The quality evaluation relied on the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool. The main results included evaluations from both theoretical and practical assessments. Additional measures consisted of assessing satisfaction and interest in learning. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies suitable for systematic review and 21 for meta-analysis, involving a total of 2517 participants. SBL greatly enhanced theoretical knowledge [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-1.32, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 89%] and practical skills (SMD = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.11-2.01, P < 0.00001, I(2) = 93%) compared to NSBL. Additionally, SBL was associated with higher satisfaction and greater interest in learning. No significant publication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: SBL significantly enhances knowledge, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning within endocrinology education compared to NSBL. These findings support the integration of high-quality SBL into endocrinology curricula to improve educational outcomes. Future research should explore the lasting effects of SBL on knowledge retention and clinical practice, as well as to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with various educational tools in diverse settings.",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-024-06010-z

39631503,Aiming for patient safety indicators in radiation oncology - Results from a systematic literature review as part of the PaSaGeRO study.,2/2025,0.634,"BACKGROUND: Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) allow the evaluation of safety levels in healthcare settings. Despite their use in various medical fields, a specific and comprehensive PSI catalogue for radiation oncology (RO) is lacking. The Patient Safety in German Radiation Oncology (PaSaGeRO) study aims for the development of a specific PSI catalogue in radiation oncology. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this systematic literature review as part of the PaSaGeRO study is to identify, formulate, and categorize PSIs specific to RO to bridge existing gaps in comprehensive patient safety evaluation. METHODS: An electronic search in PubMed included studies from 1989 onwards, in English or German, focusing on safety and quality indicators in RO, patient safety measures, or risk analyses. Exclusions were non-transferable, country-specific measures, techniques exclusive to specific departments, and legally mandated procedures. Additional sources were identified through reference tracking and professional society websites. Two experts independently extracted PSIs from the included references. RESULTS: Out of 157 included publications and nine secondary sources, we identified and formulated 145 PSIs. These were categorized into patient-specific processes (82, 56%), quality and risk management (42, 28%), human resources (15, 10%), and institutional culture (13, 9%).

39404195,Cost-Utility Analysis of Teledermatology Units in Primary Care Centers Versus Face-to-Face Dermatology Consultations in the Hospital.,1/2025,0.675,"OBJECTIVE: To perform an economic evaluation to determine whether or not teledermatology (TD) units in primary care (PC) centers offer an alternative in terms of cost-utility and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to conventional dermatology consultations (face-to-face dermatology [F-F/D]) at the hospital from the perspective of the Public Health System (PHS) and the patients. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, nonblinded, and multicenter study. During 6 months, data from 450 patients (TD: 225 vs. F-F/D: 225) were collected. From both perspectives, costs, quality of life, and costs per QALYs were analyzed. The QALY scores were estimated from the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ5D-5L) questionnaire responses. RESULTS: From the perspective of the PHS, the cost per patient was 53.04% lower in the TD group (p < 0.001). Hospital visits decreased by 72.43% in the TD group (p < 0.001). From the patients' perspective, TD reduced costs per patient by 77.59% (p < 0.001). The cost per QALY was 63.34% higher in the F-F/D group (p < 0.001). The TD group's total costs were 56.34% lower (p < 0.001). Furthermore, patients in the TD group gained 0.05 QALYs more than those in the F-F/D group (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that TD units in PC represent a significant cost-effective alternative to conventional hospital follow-up. To enhance TD in PC, it is important to introduce remote consultation platforms incorporating artificial intelligence for prediagnosis. This will enable general practitioners and nurses to make more accurate initial assessments. It is also crucial to provide thorough training to healthcare personnel using these technologies to ensure more efficient and personalized care. Public health nurses will benefit from gaining new skills in managing digital tools, which will help in the early identification of dermatological diseases and reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists. This will optimize resources and improve response times for patients.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13438
39738608,Publication count of matched dermatology applicants reported in literature: a systematic review.,12/2024,0.616,"Competitive medical residency specialties, such as Dermatology, have historically placed lofty demands on applicants. We focus on the seemingly increasing demands on applicants to publish, as well as discuss and quantify the delivery of these expectations in the literature. The objective of this article is to systematically review evidence regarding the number of publications possessed by successful applicants to a dermatology residency program. We conducted a systematic review of the literature published before or by April 2023, with no lower limit regarding the publishing date using PubMed, Google Scholar, and OVID. Our summary included 41 publications that specifically cited the number of publications by National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) applicants successfully matching to US dermatology programs. We extracted additional applicant details (demographics, publication type) as available. We found two major categories of cumulative publications reported in the literature: NRMP scholarly works and peer-reviewed indexed publications. Summarizing reports from 21 papers between 2011 and 2022, NRMP showed the overall mean amongst matched applicants to be 14.77 publications, with an upward trend over time. The mean was 3.23 peer-reviewed indexed publications (PIPs) for successful dermatology applicants amongst 11 articles in the literature. Amongst matched dermatology applicants, an average of 3 PIPs is markedly lower than the inflated average count of 15 NRMP scholarly works (which includes non-published research) that is often reported in the literature and national statistics.

40050882,A comparative study of irrigation techniques and the development of a self-serve training model for ophthalmology residents.,3/2025,0.693,"BACKGROUND: Lacrimal irrigation is a fundamental skill for diagnosing and managing lacrimal diseases. This study evaluates two lacrimal irrigation techniques and introduces a haptic-visual integrated self-serve training model to enhance skill acquisition among novice ophthalmology residents. METHODS: Ninety-two ophthalmology residents were randomized into Group A (n = 47) and Group B (n = 45). Both groups completed an 8-hour training program comprising theoretical instruction, demonstrations, and hands-on practice. Group A provided feedback to refine the training model, which was subsequently implemented in Group B1 (n = 23), while Group B2 (n = 22) served as the control. Outcomes were assessed through skill evaluations and post-training questionnaires measuring confidence scores and perceived efficacy. RESULTS: In Group A, 70.2% of participants preferred Technique 1 for its perceived ease of use, while 29.8% favored Technique 2 for pressurized irrigation scenarios (p < 0.05). Key barriers to proficiency included the absence of suitable training models (63.8%) and psychological anxiety (25.5%). In Group B, participants using the training model (Group B1) demonstrated significantly higher confidence scores compared to Group B2 (8.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.1 +/- 1.5, p < 0.05). Although skill assessment scores showed a positive trend in Group B1 (80.7 +/- 8.3 vs. 76.8 +/- 9.1), the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both lacrimal irrigation techniques are equally accessible to novices, with Technique 2 offering advantages in pressurized irrigation. The self-serve training model significantly enhances procedural confidence and addresses critical training barriers, including resource limitations and psychological safety.

39111520,Artificial Intelligence and Ophthalmic Clinical Registries.,12/2024,0.616,"PURPOSE: The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) represent a promising solution to increasing clinical demand and ever limited health resources. Whilst powerful, AI models require vast amounts of representative training data to output meaningful predictions in the clinical environment. Clinical registries represent a promising source of large volume real-world data which could be used to train more accurate and widely applicable AI models. This review aims to provide an overview of the current applications of AI to ophthalmic clinical registry data. DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic search of EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science for primary research articles that applied AI to ophthalmic clinical registry data was conducted in July 2024. RESULTS: Twenty-three primary research articles applying AI to ophthalmic clinic registries (n = 14) were found. Registries were primarily defined by the condition captured and the most common conditions where AI was applied were glaucoma (n = 3) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (n = 3). Tabular clinical data was the most common form of input into AI algorithms and outputs were primarily classifiers (n = 8, 40%) and risk quantifier models (n = 7, 35%). The AI algorithms applied were almost exclusively supervised conventional machine learning models (n = 39, 85%) such as decision tree classifiers and logistic regression, with only 7 applications of deep learning or natural language processing algorithms. Significant heterogeneity was found with regards to model validation methodology and measures of performance. CONCLUSIONS: Limited applications of deep learning algorithms to clinical registry data have been reported. The lack of standardized validation methodology and heterogeneity of performance outcome reporting suggests that the application of AI to clinical registries is still in its infancy constrained by the poor accessibility of registry data and reflecting the need for a standardization of methodology and greater involvement of domain experts in the future development of clinically deployable AI.",American journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2024.07.039
40050016,Multi-institutional exploration of pediatric residents' perspectives on anti-racism curricula: a qualitative study.,12/2025,0.553,"BACKGROUND: Anti-racism curricula are increasingly being recognized as an integral component of medical education. To our knowledge, there has not yet been a publication exploring resident perspectives from multiple institutions and explicitly representing both underrepresented in medicine (UIM) and non-UIM perspectives. OBJECTIVE: To explore and compare UIM and non-UIM pediatric residents' perspectives on the content and qualities of meaningful anti-racism curricula. METHODS: We performed an IRB-approved multi-institutional, qualitative study that incorporated Sotto-Santiago et al's conceptual framework for anti-racism education. Between February and May 2021, we conducted focus groups of UIM and non-UIM pediatric residents at three large residency programs in the United States. We developed focus group guides using literature review, expert consensus, feedback from study team racial equity experts, and piloting. Focus groups were conducted virtually, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. We employed thematic analysis to code transcripts, create categories, and develop themes until we reached thematic sufficiency. We completed member checking to ensure trustworthiness of themes. RESULTS: Forty residents participated (19 UIM and 21 non-UIM) in a total of six focus groups. We identified 7 themes, summarized as: 1) racism in medicine is pervasive, therefore (2) anti-racism education is critical to the development of competent physicians, and 3) education should extend to all healthcare providers. 4) Residents desired education focused on action-oriented strategies to advance anti-racism, 5) taught by those with both learned and lived experiences with racism, 6) in a psychologically safe space for UIM residents, and 7) with adequate time and financial resources for successful implementation and engagement. CONCLUSION: Our multi-institutional study affirms the need for pediatric resident anti-racism education, promotes co-creation as a method to affect culture change, and provides practical strategies for curricular design and implementation.",Medical education online,https://doi.org/10.1080/10872981.2025.2474134
39934466,Evidence certainty in neonatology-a meta-epidemiological analysis of Cochrane reviews.,2/2025,0.634,"We hypothesized that certainty of the available evidence is relatively low in neonatology. Thus, we designed a meta-epidemiological review to examine what is the certainty of evidence in the latest Cochrane neonatal reviews and investigate if the number of trials and enrolled patients is associated with the certainty of evidence. We searched Cochrane neonatal reviews published between January 2022 and May 2024. We included all reviews on interventions concerning neonates that had at least one meta-analysis performed with GRADE-rated evidence certainty. From those reviews, we extracted the presented certainty of evidence and analyzed its association with the number of trials and participants by ANOVA. We screened 55 Cochrane reviews and included 49 of them. In these 49 reviews, there were 443 reported outcomes with graded certainty of evidence. The certainty was reported to be high in 8 (1.8%), moderate in 89 (20.2%), low in 195 (44.0%), and very low in 151 (34%) of the outcomes. Reviews reporting outcomes with higher certainty of evidence had significantly more trials and patients (approximately 3 and 1.5 times more, respectively) than those with only low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION: In the past 2 years, Cochrane neonatal reviews have generally had low or very low certainty of evidence for most outcomes. Only 2% of the reviewed outcomes had high certainty. The number of included patients and trials significantly affected the certainty. These findings highlight the continuous need for better quality and larger trials. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Neonatology is among the largest specialities and the evidence certainties of interventions have been varying. * Neonatal patients and studies need to consider the uniqueness of the patients and the acute situations in the study designs. WHAT IS NEW: * The included 49 reviews consisted of 443 outcomes and of these only 1.8% were classified as high certainty of evidence. * Higher evidence certainties were associated with higher number of included trials and participants.",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-025-06023-w

METHODS: Fourth-year medical paediatric students at our university in 2020 were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, experimental group 1, and experimental group 2, with 30 students in each group. The control group received traditional teaching, experimental group 1 received a combination of online and offline teaching using two methods simultaneously, and experimental group 2, in addition to the methods used in experimental group 1, engaged in real-case teaching in the ward. The teaching outcomes were evaluated through theoretical exams, clinical skills assessments, and questionnaires. RESULTS: Experimental groups 1 and 2 were superior to the control group concerning theoretical examination and overall scores (P < 0.05). Experimental group 2 was superior to experimental group 1 and the control group in clinical skills examination scores (P < 0.05). The satisfaction rate for the questionnaire was highest in experimental group 2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined use of various teaching methods with online and offline modes is more effective than using traditional teaching methods only in paediatric education. It enhances the overall competence of paediatric students, especially in terms of improving clinical skills, and is well-received by both students and teachers.",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-024-06267-4
40088784,Combining non-targeted high resolution mass spectrometry with effect-directed analysis to identify contaminants of emerging concern in the field of ecotoxicology: A systematic quantitative literature review.,4/2025,0.653,"Methods for measuring environmental toxicity and identifying chemical toxicity drivers using non-targeted analysis (NTA) were reviewed in this systematic quantitative literature review. Effect-directed analysis (EDA) was used to assess sample toxicity and prioritise NTA sample analysis. The most common bioassays performed were estrogen, androgen and aryl hydrocarbon receptor assays, with many studies using test batteries. Across the 95 studies in this review, the toxicity could be explained (>75 %) for eight studies, four studies had toxicity endpoints explained and unexplained, and 38 studies had unexplained (<75 %) toxicity. The addition of NTA allowed for toxicity to be explained with a median of 47 % for TOX(non-target) studies and 34 % for TOX(target+non-target), far higher than the 13 % median for TOX(target) studies within this review. The outcomes of identification were affected by method factors including sample extraction, chromatography method, data acquisition and data processing. Method factors with the biggest potential to introduce selection bias were sample extraction and chromatography technique. These factors were characterised by a high representation of reverse phase liquid chromatography contributing to the selective exclusion of polar, highly polar and ionic compounds from sample analysis. This reduces compound identification and excludes unknown chemical contaminants from analysis. Not all studies reported the explained toxicity contribution of identified compounds, however it was evident that many compound features could not be identified using NTA processing software. There were severe limitations for liquid chromatography data compared to gas chromatography data with insufficient spectral library databases for spectra matching. This bottleneck is partially solved through the rise in in silico and retention time prediction software. Future work, including increasing spectral databases for liquid chromatography, use of less biased chromatography and sample preparation techniques and inclusion of EDA-NTA into risk assessment frameworks, will allow for better toxicity assessment of emerging contaminants.",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.179122
39454772,Impacts of micro/nano plastics on the ecotoxicological effects of antibiotics in agricultural soil: A comprehensive study based on meta-analysis and machine learning prediction.,12/2024,0.616,"Micro/nano plastics (M/NPs) and antibiotics, as widely coexisting pollutants in environment, pose serious threats to soil ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the ecological effects of the co-exposure of M/NPs and antibiotics on soil organisms through the meta-analysis and machine learning prediction. Totally, 1002 data set from 38 articles were studied. The co-exposure of M/NPs significantly promoted the abundance (62.68 %) and migration level (55.22 %) of antibiotic contamination in soil, and caused serious biotoxicity to plants (-12.31 %), animals (-12.03 %), and microorganisms (35.07 %). Using 10 variables, such as risk response categories, basic physicochemical properties, exposure objects, and exposure time of M/NPs, as data sources, Random Forests (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were developed to predict the impacts of M/NPs on the ecotoxicological effects of antibiotics in agricultural soil. The effective R(2) values (0.58 and 0.60, respectively) indicated that both models can be used to predict the future ecological risk of M/NPs and antibiotics coexistence in soil. Particle size (13.54 %), concentration (5.02 %), and type (11.18 %) of M/NPs were the key characteristic parameters that affected the prediction results. The findings of this study indicate that the co-exposure of M/NPs and antibiotics in soil not only exacerbates antibiotic contamination levels but also causes severe toxic effects to soil organism. Furthermore, this study provides an effective approach for ecological risk assessment of the coexistence of M/NPs and antibiotics in environment.",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177076
39316471,Critical Evaluation and Meta-Analysis of Ecotoxicological Data on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Freshwater Species.,10/2024,0.6,"Despite the increasing concern regarding the ecological risks posed by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a lack of comprehensive understanding of their actual ecotoxicity remains. Through a meticulous examination of 91 peer-reviewed studies investigating effects at a population level and constructing probabilistic species sensitivity distributions (PSSDs), we present a state-of-the-science hazard assessment of PFAS in freshwater species. Using data subsets containing suboptimal data led to an overestimation of the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) of PFAS. We report PNECs of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) in freshwater to be 4.8-2000 mug/L and 0.4-8.9 mug/L, respectively, derived from high-quality data. Statistical analyses revealed that both functional groups and carbon chain length significantly influenced (p < 0.05) the variations in toxicity observed among different PFAS. This study underscores the importance of obtaining high-quality PFAS ecotoxicity data to comprehend associated hazards. The PNECs of PFAS derived in this study are higher compared to those of micro/nanoplastics and persistent organic pollutants. Our research offers valuable insights into prioritizing the regulation of more toxic PFAS.",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c04818

METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and relied on the following sources of evidence: (1) a systematic review examining the desirable and undesirable effects (ie, benefits and harms) of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, (2) a microsimulation study estimating the effects of CADe on longer-term patient-important outcomes, (3) a systematic search of evidence evaluating the values and preferences of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and (4) a systematic review of studies evaluating health care providers' trust in artificial intelligence technology in gastroenterology. RESULTS: The panel reached the conclusion that no recommendation could be made for or against the use of CADe-assisted colonoscopy in light of very low certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes, desirable and undesirable (11 fewer colorectal cancers per 10,000 individuals and 2 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 10,000 individuals), increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications. The panel acknowledged the 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%) increase in adenoma detection rate and 2% (95% CI, 0%-4%) increase in advanced adenoma and/or sessile serrated lesion detection rate. CONCLUSIONS: This guideline highlights the close tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects and the limitations in the current evidence to support a recommendation. The panel acknowledged the potential for CADe to continually improve as an iterative artificial intelligence application. Ongoing publications providing evidence for critical outcomes will help inform a future recommendation.",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2025.01.002
39915703,A foundation systematic review of natural language processing applied to gastroenterology & hepatology.,2/2025,0.634,"OBJECTIVE: This review assesses the progress of NLP in gastroenterology to date, grades the robustness of the methodology, exposes the field to a new generation of authors, and highlights opportunities for future research. DESIGN: Seven scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for studies published between 2015 and 2023 that met the inclusion criteria. Studies lacking a description of appropriate validation or NLP methods were excluded, as were studies ufinavailable in English, those focused on non-gastrointestinal diseases and those that were duplicates. Two independent reviewers extracted study information, clinical/algorithm details, and relevant outcome data. Methodological quality and bias risks were appraised using a checklist of quality indicators for NLP studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were identified utilising NLP in endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and pancreatic disease. Colonoscopy was the focus of 21 (38.9%) studies; 13 (24.1%) focused on liver disease, 7 (13.0%) on inflammatory bowel disease, 4 (7.4%) on gastroscopy, 4 (7.4%) on pancreatic disease and 2 (3.7%) on endoscopic sedation/ERCP and gastrointestinal bleeding. Only 30 (56.6%) of the studies reported patient demographics, and only 13 (24.5%) had a low risk of validation bias. Thirty-five (66%) studies mentioned generalisability, but only 5 (9.4%) mentioned explainability or shared code/models. CONCLUSION: NLP can unlock substantial clinical information from free-text notes stored in EPRs and is already being used, particularly to interpret colonoscopy and radiology reports. However, the models we have thus far lack transparency, leading to duplication, bias, and doubts about generalisability. Therefore, greater clinical engagement, collaboration, and open sharing of appropriate datasets and code are needed.",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-025-03608-5
39705703,Large Language Models in Gastroenterology: Systematic Review.,12/2024,0.616,"BACKGROUND: As health care continues to evolve with technological advancements, the integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practices has shown promising potential to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. Among the forefront of these innovations are large language models (LLMs), a subset of artificial intelligence designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at an unprecedented scale. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review describes the role of LLMs in improving diagnostic accuracy, automating documentation, and advancing specialist education and patient engagement within the field of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: Core databases including MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central registry were searched using keywords related to LLMs (from inception to April 2024). Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) any type of studies that investigated the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) studies published in English, and (3) studies in full-text format. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did not report the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) case reports and review papers, (3) ineligible research objects (eg, animals or basic research), and (4) insufficient data regarding the potential role of LLMs. Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions was used to evaluate the quality of the identified studies. RESULTS: Overall, 21 studies on the potential role of LLMs in gastrointestinal disorders were included in the systematic review, and narrative synthesis was done because of heterogeneity in the specified aims and methodology in each included study. The overall risk of bias was low in 5 studies and moderate in 16 studies. The ability of LLMs to spread general medical information, offer advice for consultations, generate procedure reports automatically, or draw conclusions about the presumptive diagnosis of complex medical illnesses was demonstrated by the systematic review. Despite promising benefits, such as increased efficiency and improved patient outcomes, challenges related to data privacy, accuracy, and interdisciplinary collaboration remain. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the importance of navigating these challenges to fully leverage LLMs in transforming gastrointestinal endoscopy practices.

A Systematic Literature Review from the European Association of Urology Patient Office.,11/2024,0.608,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Discussions surrounding urological diagnoses and planned procedures can be challenging, and patients might experience difficulty in understanding the medical language, even when shown radiological imaging or drawings. With the introduction of virtual reality and simulation, informed consent could be enhanced by audiovisual content and interactive platforms. Our aim was to assess the role of enhanced consent in the field of urology. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, using informed consent, simulation, and virtual reality in urology as the search terms. All original articles were screened. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Thirteen original studies were included in the review. The overall quality of these studies was deemed good according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The studies analysed the application of different modalities for enhanced consent: 3D printed or digital models, audio visual multimedia contents, virtual simulation of procedures and interactive navigable apps. Published studies agreed upon a significantly improved effect on patient understanding of the diagnosis, including basic anatomical details, and surgery-related issues such as the aim, steps and the risks connected to the planned intervention. Patient satisfaction was unanimously reported as improved as a result of enhanced consent.

This study aimed to evaluate their daily exposure to seven selected competencies from the 2022 European Training Requirements (ETR). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst 350 Portuguese anaesthesia residents, throughout a 10 working day period, using a questionnaire with 170 questions. Participants were on either anaesthesia or intensive care unit rotation. Demographic data and scores of exposures to selected competencies were gathered. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, comparison of means and a Linear Mixed Model using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method. The significance threshold was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Regarding ETR competency exposure, no statistical differences were found based on gender. Residents reported statistically significant higher levels of exposure to competencies while in anaesthesia rotations, except for lung, cardiac and Point-of Care ultrasound. Apart from ultrasound and academic research activities, the maximum exposure level was attained only during anaesthesia rotations. There was no reported exposure to airway ultrasound in any rotation. Exposure to academic research activities, in a scale from 0 to 5, was on average below one. The average reported values for direct patient communication were the highest. As expected, the fifth-year residents reported overall higher scores. Residents from the North reported lower scores for general anaesthesia maintenance, peripheral regional anaesthesia, airway intubation and ventilation management, but higher scores of exposures to academic research activities. DISCUSSION: Adopting a national logbook, formative regular assessment, supporting the trainers as well as strategies to improve competencies in academic research activities and ultrasound training are recommendations to improve the Portuguese training curricula. CONCLUSION: Addressing the gaps between expected and monitored competencies contributes to the advancement of anaesthesiology training. The survey drew attention to the ETR among the residents.

38895970,"Optimizing accrual to a large-scale, clinically integrated randomized trial in anesthesiology: A 2-year analysis of recruitment.",2/2025,0.684,"BACKGROUND: Performing large randomized trials in anesthesiology is often challenging and costly. The clinically integrated randomized trial is characterized by simplified logistics embedded into routine clinical practice, enabling ease and efficiency of recruitment, offering an opportunity for clinicians to conduct large, high-quality randomized trials under low cost. Our aims were to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of the clinically integrated trial design in a high-volume anesthesiology practice and (2) assess whether trial quality improvement interventions led to more balanced accrual among study arms and improved trial compliance over time. METHODS: This is an interim analysis of recruitment to a cluster-randomized trial investigating three nerve block approaches for mastectomy with immediate implant-based reconstruction: paravertebral block (arm 1), paravertebral plus interpectoral plane blocks (arm 2), and serratus anterior plane plus interpectoral plane blocks (arm 3). We monitored accrual and consent rates, clinician compliance with the randomized treatment, and availability of outcome data. Assessment after the initial year of implementation showed a slight imbalance in study arms suggesting areas for improvement in trial compliance. Specific improvement interventions included increasing the frequency of communication with the consenting staff and providing direct feedback to clinician investigators about their individual recruitment patterns. We assessed overall accrual rates and tested for differences in accrual, consent, and compliance rates pre- and post-improvement interventions. RESULTS: Overall recruitment was extremely high, accruing close to 90% of the eligible population. In the pre-intervention period, there was evidence of bias in the proportion of patients being accrued and receiving the monthly block, with higher rates in arm 3 (90%) compared to arms 1 (81%) and 2 (79%, p = 0.021). In contrast, in the post-intervention period, there was no statistically significant difference between groups (p = 0.8). Eligible for randomization rate increased from 89% in the pre-intervention period to 95% in the post-intervention period (difference 5.7%; 95% confidence interval = 2.2%-9.4%, p = 0.002). Consent rate increased from 95% to 98% (difference of 3.7%; 95% confidence interval = 1.1%-6.3%; p = 0.004). Compliance with the randomized nerve block approach was maintained at close to 100% and availability of primary outcome data was 100%. CONCLUSION: The clinically integrated randomized trial design enables rapid trial accrual with a high participant compliance rate in a high-volume anesthesiology practice. Continuous monitoring of accrual, consent, and compliance rates is necessary to maintain and improve trial conduct and reduce potential biases. This trial methodology serves as a template for the implementation of other large, low-cost randomized trials in anesthesiology.","Clinical trials (London, England)",https://doi.org/10.1177/17407745241255087
39833856,Use of an observer tool to enhance learning of anaesthesia resident's non-technical skills during high-fidelity simulation: a randomised controlled trial.,1/2025,0.675,"BACKGROUND: The use of an observer tool (OT) has been shown to improve learning of technical skills through observation in simulation. The objective was to assess the impact of a non-technical OT on anaesthesia residents' learning of non-technical skills (NTS) during simulation. METHODS: After consent, residents were randomised into 2 groups: OT+ (with an OT based on NTS to be systematically completed during observation of others) and OT- (without OT). Both groups observed a high-fidelity simulation of crisis management (with or without OT), then were asked to perform actively another simulation. The primary outcome was NTS performance, assessed by an evaluator using the Anaesthesia Non-Technical Skills score (ANTS score out of 16) on video recording. Secondary outcomes were results of score items, satisfaction, team performance, and professional impact. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between OT + group (n = 33) and OT- group (n = 30) for the ANTS score (OT + 12 [9.5-12.5], OT- 10.5 [8.75-12]/16 (p = 0.13)). Among sub-items of the ANTS score, decision-making was significantly better in the OT + group (3 [2-3] versus 2 [2-3], p = 0.01). Satisfaction, team performance and perception of professional impact were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed no significant difference in learning of observational anaesthesia resident's NTS whether or not they were provided a non-technical OT during crisis management simulation. Decision-making was better with an OT. Further work is necessary to define the place of OT in observer-based learning.",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-024-06608-3
39794633,[Treatment quality with and without an electronic cognitive aid for emergencies in anaesthesia (eGENA) : The DANGER pilot study part 2 in randomized controlled in-situ emergency simulations].,1/2025,0.675,"BACKGROUND: The electronic cognitive aid for emergencies in anesthesia (eGENA) is an app that offers digital support in anesthesiological emergency situations as a cognitive aid tool via checklists for memory and making decisions. The eGENA was published by the German Society of Anesthesiology and has been implemented in the emergency management of the anesthesiological team of the clinic in Potsdam, Germany. OBJECTIVE: The primary endpoint was to observe the influence of eGENA on the anesthesiological emergency management on the subjective feeling of assurance as well as on quality of treatment and, therefore, patient safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All employees in the anesthesia department (nursing staff and physicians) took part in the initial implementation of eGENA. The implementation phase covered crew resource management (CRM) principles and eGENA use as well as 10 case studies that were discussed with help from eGENA. Afterwards in a randomized controlled simulation study, realistic case studies were processed and evaluated. In this, 18 cases were handled by 9 groups with 4 persons in each group. Treatment during these simulations was assessed using a predetermined 20-point evaluation form and 10 resuscitation-related and 10 case-related points were awarded. Significance tests were carried out using the Wilcoxon-test (significance level p < 0.05) and two evaluations were completed by the attendees at the beginning and the end of the eGENA implementation process. RESULTS: Scenarios 1 and 2 showed comparable overall scores (14.9 vs. 16.3 points out of 20, not significant). Higher case-associated scores (7.6 vs. 5.6 out of 10, p = 0.03) and higher total scores were achieved with the help of eGENA (16.9 vs. 14.3 out of 20, p = 0.02). Resuscitation-associated scores did not differ significantly (9.3 vs. 8.8 of 10, p = 0.1). During eGENA use for cases the execution of the algorithm-based resuscitation measures was not delayed or accelerated. With eGENA, however, differential diagnoses were discussed significantly more frequently and expanded treatment and diagnostic measures were implemented. During simulation cases eGENA was mainly used by physicians. The initially very positive responses of the evaluations toned down over time. Planned eGENA use for self-study was less frequent (p = 0.006) and there was less approval of the quality of treatment by eGENA than in the first survey (p = 0.002). The cooperation between doctors and nurses in emergency treatment showed an improvement (p < 0.001). The questions about self-assessed safety in emergency treatment on a scale from 0 to 10 showed higher values in all categories at the second survey (except only circulatory emergencies and 'other' emergencies). The respondents were more likely to be involved in emergency treatment at the second time of the survey (p = 0.03) after a median of 20 months. DISCUSSION: The sense of security and emergency involvement increased significantly over the observation period. The initial need to use eGENA in everyday life has diminished over time; however, these results cannot be causally associated with eGENA. The use of eGENA does not improve resuscitation efforts but does not delay them either. With the use of eGENA better case-associated results are achieved and advanced diagnostics and treatment are implemented more frequently in complex emergency situations. This increases the quality of treatment. Further studies should be carried out with a larger number of cases to confirm the shown effects.",Die Anaesthesiologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-024-01493-3
39707052,The gender gap in academic anesthesiology and critical care medicine: a systematic review.,1/2025,0.625,"PURPOSE: Gender disparities in academia are a growing concern, impacting various disciplines, including health care. We aimed to investigate gender-based differences in academic performance, leadership roles, and academic distinction within anesthesiology and critical care medicine. SOURCE: We conducted electronic searches for relevant articles published in PubMed, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, Education Resources Information Center, PsychINFO, and ProQuest from database inception until 23 June 2024. Three researchers conducted blinded assessments using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with discrepancies resolved through discussion. We reported descriptive statistics for quantitative data from the included research articles. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our initial screening identified 37,311 studies, 71 of which met the specified inclusion criteria and were therefore evaluated. Analysis of academic publishing trends revealed a gradual increase in the proportion of women as coauthors, first authors (in anesthesiology, the increase ranged from 7% to 17%, and in critical care medicine the increase was 4%), last authors, and corresponding authors. Despite these improvements, women remain underrepresented on the editorial boards of top journals. Although an increase in the representation of women as abstract presenters at conferences was noted, gender disparities persist in senior authorship roles. CONCLUSION: Gender disparities are evident in academic leadership positions within anesthesiology and critical care medicine, with few women holding editor-in-chief positions and underrepresentation of women on editorial boards. We observed similar gaps in departmental and scientific society leadership roles. The distribution of awards, prizes, and grants remains skewed, indicating persistent gender imbalances in academic distinction. While progress has been made in certain areas, substantial gaps persist in scholarly publishing, leadership, and academic distinction.

39709419,"Effect of mild sedation and analgesia on radial artery cannulation in novice residents: a prospective, randomized controlled trial.",12/2024,0.666,"BACKGROUND: Radial artery cannulation can be challenging, particularly for inexperienced providers. This study aimed to compare the success rates of resident physicians performing radial artery cannulation with mild sedation and analgesia versus without. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective, single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial. Twelve anesthesiology residents performed radial artery insertions on 96 patients. The procedures were conducted with either mild sedation and analgesia (treatment group) or an equivalent volume of 0.9%Nacl (control group), in a random order. The primary outcome was the success rate of radial artery cannulation within 10 min for each group. Secondary outcomes included the first-attempt success rate, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, and self-reported patient discomfort scores (0 corresponding to ""no anxious"", 1 corresponding to ""mildly anxious"", 2 corresponding to ""moderately anxious"" and 3 corresponding to ""very anxious""). RESULTS: The success rate of radial artery cannulation within 10 min was 75.0% (36/48) in the treatment group and 54.2% (26/48) in the control group, respectively (difference 20.8%; P = 0.033, OR: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.02-1.88). The first-attempt success rate was 68.8% (33/48) in the treatment group, compared to 52.1% (25/48) in the control group (difference 16.7%; P = 0.095, OR: 1.32, 95%CI: 0.95-1.84). The VAS scores and self-reported patient discomfort scores were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (2.0 [2.0, 2.0] vs. 3.0 [2.0, 4.0], P = 0.005; 1.0 [0.0, 2.0] vs. 2.0 [2.0, 2.0], P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The success rate of radial artery cannulation within 10 min significantly increased for anesthesiology residents with the use of mild sedation and analgesia. Additionally, these medications resulted in a notable reduction in procedure-related pain and patient discomfort.

METHODS: A total of 24 anesthesia residents were randomly divided into a video group and a control group. Residents in both groups took part in a simulated interview and received a scenario-based lecture on how to communicate with patients during preoperative visits. Afterwards, residents in the video group received personalized video feedback recorded during the simulated interview. One week later all the residents undertook another simulated interview. The communication skills of all the residents were assessed using the Consultation and Relational Empathy measure (CARE) scale by two examiners and one standardized patient (SP), both of whom were blinded to the group allocation. RESULTS: CARE scores were comparable between the two groups before training, and significantly improved after training in both groups (all P < 0.05). The video group showed significantly greater increase in CARE score after the training than the control group, especially assessed by the SP (t = 6.980, P <0.001). There were significant correlations between the examiner-assessed scores and SP-assessed scores (both P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Scenario-based lectures with simulated interviews provide a good method for training communication skills of anesthesia residents, and personalized video feedback can enhance their performance on showing empathy during preoperative interview.",Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,https://doi.org/10.24920/004379
